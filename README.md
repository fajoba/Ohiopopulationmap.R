# Ohiopopulationmap.R
I am going to try to replicate u/halhen's Europe population map with a map of Ohio.

My R skills, and frankly all my programming skills, are extremely juvenile at best. Additionally this is the first project I have done on GitHub, so we'll see how this goes. Basically my plan is to copy his code, and then try to find a data source for Ohio populations. I'll then try to tweak things and see if I can learn some of the functions that way. 
Cool.
